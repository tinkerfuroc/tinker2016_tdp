\begin{abstract}
This paper describes our service robot Tinker of Tsinghua University, China, including the mechanical system, hardware system and software system. Tinker is designed to be an autonomous robot in domestic environment, capable of navigating in complicated environment and finishing different tasks, mainly following the rules of @Home League of World RoboCup 2016. This paper introduces both the hardware design of the robot and the algorithms we have proposed and implemented.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
Tinker is developed by FuRoC (Future Robotics Club), a student group in Tsinghua University focusing on robotics, AI and related areas. It is our third participation in the @home League of World RoboCup. Tinker is designed to be an autonomous humanoid robot mainly for home service. To complete home service tasks, abilities such as automatic navigation, environment perception, interaction with human, recognizing and carrying small objects, etc, are required. Tinker is equipped with a mobile chassis, a lift platform, a 6-DoF arm, and different kinds of sensors. Depth cameras (PrimeSense and Microsoft Kinect) are used for imaging and recognizing environment, objects and different user. A laser scanner is used for sensing the surroundings and navigation. Tinker is also equipped with a microphone for hearing and understanding voice orders.

\section{Conclusion}

As we have introduced in the above sections, Tinker is our young robot, with mobile chassis, Ball screw Actuator and a 6-DoF arm and various sensors including RGB cameras, depth cameras and laser range finders. We developed, implemented and adopted algorithms for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, face recognition, human tracking, object recognition and speech recognition, with which the robot becomes intelligent and is capable for many home service tasks. 

%As Tinker is young, there are still a lot of things to learn and improve.
