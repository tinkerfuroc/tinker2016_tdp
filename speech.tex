Natural Language understanding provides a convenient way to interact with a robot. Currently, we apply the CMU Sphinx package\cite{lamere2003cmu} for speech recognition. We update the keywords database by adding necessary words and phrases for understanding different orders and compile it into a library file. When the software recognizes a sequence of special keywords, the robot interprets one's intention and makes corresponding responses.
