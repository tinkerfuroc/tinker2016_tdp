For 2019 competition, we implement speech interaction system based on google TTS(Text-To-Speech) and STT(Speech-To-Text) Cloud API. To overcome communication delay from robot and cloud platform, we realize a stream based audio transfrom method for speech recognition. Moreover, Tinker caches a huge amount of audio response template locally to accelerate robot correspondance.

After speech to text layer, dialogue system consists of a simple keyword parser, which takes keywords in certain patterns to operate task switches: When the software recognizes a sequence with one of the predefined patterns, the robot interprets one's intention and makes corresponding responses. Sound source localization method is realized by IFLYTEK develop toolkit.
